            <p>
                In my resume, you will see that I have a wide web development skillset. I have built POCs from the ground
                up. I have worked in enterprise environments on projects that have over 100,000 requests per hour on peak
                days. I have worked on VR ecommerce concepts, and I have even performed the research associated with
                developing a robust computer vision based checkout system. I have integrated LLM AI models into client
                projects, and I have excelled working in teams both large (more than 20 people) and small (less than 5).

                My resume will show you what I have done professionally, but I am so much more than just that piece of
                paper.
